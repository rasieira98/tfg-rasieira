# Ramón Sieira Martínez – Bachelor’s Thesis  
## Application for the Classification of Bat Echolocation Groups Using Deep Learning

- In recent years, there has been a continuous surge of innovations in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Computer vision is one of the most extensively explored branches. This thesis focuses on classifying audio recordings of bat ultrasound signals using deep learning models capable of detecting patterns in the generated spectrograms.

- Accurate species identification and classification are fundamental to any wildlife study, making reliable recognition essential. To address this need, we developed a specialized tool that determines the echolocation group of a given recording of local bat ultrasounds. For one particular group (pipistrelle-like species), it was further necessary to classify recordings into distinct subgroups.
